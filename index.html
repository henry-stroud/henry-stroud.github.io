        About
      </h1>
      <p>
        My previous role as a music publicist gave me huge insight into the world of client based project management and team coordination, both locally and internationally. Over the course of three years, I connected artists and festivals with journalists worldwide, creating profile pieces and magazine features to be delivered on strict timeframes.

        Moving into web development was a natural progression for me. I have always had a keen interest in technology and working out new software in my spare time. I’ve taught myself Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro and have used these skills extensively in my director role at Bade Records. I wanted to link my passion for tech with my ability to learn new skills, and the WDI course at General Assembly was the next logical step in my career.

        I took on the project solo in order to cement all the skills I had learnt over the course. I created an application that took data from YouTube’s API and created a marketplace for buying and selling videos with game credit. The biggest challenge was creating my own back-end models that referenced YouTube’s data, but added prices to each video.

        In a team of three we built a Full-Stack gaming social network application that used an external API (IGDB) to gather game data. We were able to add a reference to each game into our back-end, and attach our own comments and ratings models to that reference. We also created a live chatbox with socket.io so users could chat live on the app, as well as creating user profiles and linking through users and comments so the site was a fully cyclical experience.

        We chose to use 4 APIs, Spotify, LastFM, MusixMatch and Mapbox, in order to create an application with which you can search any artist in the world and it will display their top 10 tracks, biography, where they are from and if they are on tour or not. The project was a success and it was interesting working in a pair, using teletype on our text editor to share code simultaneously.

        I began by mapping out the game-logic and set about building the project design and functionality step-by-step. I created a computer AI which ‘knew’ when it had hit a ship and then calculated whether it had sunk a ship or not, and then fired in the next logical direction that the ship could be placed. I also made sure that no ships could touch each other as per the rules of the game, using a series of conditional statements.
